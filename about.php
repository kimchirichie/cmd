			    clickMD is a new telemedicine company that offers online video conferencing service that connects patients with doctors in a timely and convenient manner. Our physicians are all fully licensed to practice in the province of Ontario. We provide services to residents of Ontario, who are in Ontario at the time of assessment and who have valid OHIP coverage. Sorry, we cannot see patients who are outside of Ontario at the time of assessment. Although patients require OHIP coverage to use clickMD, we do not bill OHIP for our services. Our fee is to cover the cost of bringing our service to you in a modern and convenient way.</p>
